            </h2>
            <p>Onychomycosis, commonly known as feet fungus, is a fungal infection affecting the toenails or
                fingernails. It often begins as a white or yellow spot under the tip of the nail and can cause
                the nail to become discolored, thickened, and brittle over time.

                                of the nail, typically appearing white, yellow, or brown.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Clean the Affected Area: </b> <br>
                        Start with clean, dry nails. Wash and thoroughly dry the affected area before applying OnycoFix.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Spray the Solution:</b><br>
                        Hold the spray nozzle close to the affected nail and spray evenly. Ensure complete coverage of
                        the infected nail and its surrounding areas.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Allow to Dry:</b><br>
                        Let the solution air-dry for a few minutes. No need to rinse off â€“ OnycoFix absorbs quickly for
                        your convenience.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Repeat as Directed:</b><br>
                        Follow the recommended application instructions provided. Consistency is key to achieving
                        optimal results.

                <p class="content">"I take quite a few supplements, but OnycoFix is the only product that made a massive difference in
                    my life within a few weeks. I had been in horrible pain due to my toenail fungus for many months.
                    Even though I've tried various treatments, OnycoFix was the game-changer. I don't know what exactly
                    OnycoFix does to the nails, but on the 21st day of using it, I noticed a big difference, and the
                    improvement continued. Suddenly, I was able to walk without any discomfort or pain. Thank you,
